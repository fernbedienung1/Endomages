\section{Acquired Data}
    The Bench-test perfomed on the 21.12.2018 resulted in \cmt{N GB Raw Video data}. \\
    Table with files? \\

    \subsection{Facts}
        Very dark images - only one light source 
        durations / sizes / other values ... table format
    
    \subsection{Comparision}
        \subsubsection{realism}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item wie ein unbeholfener arzt
                \item quite dark - due to single light source
            \end{itemize}
            
        \subsubsection{quality}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item tools good
                \item movements different - nor bad or good
                \item static setup nice to work with in algorithm programming
            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Use in Application}
        Generated data is used to generate the algorithms while they are evaluated against the real data. \\
        This is done to avoid overfitting of the algorithm to special data. \\
